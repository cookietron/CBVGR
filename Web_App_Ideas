Web application requirements/thoughts:
Security: Users should require authentication to help prevent misuse
Should host the recording script as an executable to download.
Should allow users to upload their logs, and maybe choose the game ID by using an AJAX call to Freebase game records?
Server side script adds the raw log to a database table
Processes similarity algorithms and stores them in similarity tables so they don't have to be re-generated.
Maybe store everything using triples/RDF linking games to logs, logs to users, logs to metrics, etc?
