CBVGR
=====
CBVGR stands for Content-Based Video Game Retrieval.
Content-Based Retrieval is a branch of information retrieval that attempts to provide access to multimedia materials by way of queries that more closely resemble the material that will be returned.
A good example of this in practice is the image search feature that Google now provides that allows a user to upload or link to another image and can find similar images using the original (rather than text keywords).
Video games are a medium that might benefit from such methods, especially since video game genres are incessantly slippery and run the risk of being alienating (e.g. rogue-like-likes?) or meaningless altogether.
This project as an attempt therefore at a) capturing video game user input--based on the assumption that input is a key defining feature of interactive media, b) processing gameplay logs into gameplay profiles, and c) using the resulting profiles to gauge the similarity of different games.

This will be updated when code is uploaded. :)
